This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in computer science
- I am taking STATS 220 because I'm bored
- I am interested in learning about absolutely nothing

1. I play some **footbal**l in my spare time
2. My favourite idol is Cristiano Ronaldo, a little about him [Cristiano Ronaldo Offical Website](https://www.cristianoronaldo.com/#cr7).
3. I enjoying _taking pictures_ of the little details in life

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![](asset/)
